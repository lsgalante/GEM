    > Regarding Scale

        I've tried to use a 1 millimeter:1 unit equivalancy. This scale is so much broader than any scale I've worked with before and the numbers become arbitrarily large. I think that I should use 1 centimeter:1 unit scale in the future.

    > Regarding GEM Mold Shell

        One of the most important parameters is the thickness range of the GEM Mold Shell operator. It is necessary to choose a thickness that is thick enough to print properly and have maintain adequate rigidity while also being thin enough to remove post-resing cure post-hydrocal cure.

        According to the original cast which had very good parameters for the GEM Mold Shell, the parameters were set to the following choices:

            Maximum Thickness..... 0.75 (mm/units)
            Minumum Thickness..... 0.6  (mm/units)
            Remesh Division Size.. 0.9
            Ramp.................. Linear

    > Regarding UV Curing

        Using my Peopoly Phenom curing box, I have basically been using the default settings from 3-6 minutes. I think it would be a good idea to do like 5 minutes of interval curing, if I can figure out how.
